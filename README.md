# Simple-Linear-Regression

This is a simple Linear Regression Model in python using the python's machine learning library. The model plots a straight line after being trained on a training set and its performance is evaluated for a testing set.

Requirements:
    1) Python 2.7+
    Required python libraries:
    1) numpy
    2) matplotlib
    3) pandas
    4) sklearn

The python implementation uses the sklearn library to build a regression model which is trained with the training set. The graph for the regression line is plotted against the original data values.

Before using the dataset, the data preprocessing is done.
